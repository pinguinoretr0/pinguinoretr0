### Trong aka TheLinuxPirate
17 year old software developer

As of now I still am very ambitious and have lots of goals in mind.
But I still have lots to learn.

I'd like to develop my own organization where I can develop software with a purpose & get into
game modification. An example being Project-Breadbug where I'd like to find a way to bring Netplay
to the game Pikmin 2, which is no easy task...

## Currently Working On

# Extra
## The Startup
ThePirateCove is small startup organization that hopes to develop FOSS & develop games for 
the entertainment of others. ThePirateCove hopes to inspire others to try their hand at development &
embrace the idea of Open Source software where fellow users of that software can contribute to it.
