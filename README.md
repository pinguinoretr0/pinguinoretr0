### TheLinuxPirate
Hello, I am a very goofy programmer who is still learning the very basics my goals as of now is to 
create a Discord bot fully written in Rust and either try to implement OpenAI shit, or add Real World the Game
as a playable feature...

My projects as of now are:
- Zonaimacs // My Personal Emacs configuration
- Wiggler // A simple Discord bot written in rust
- Real World The Game // Simple board game turned into a Nim project
