### TheLinuxPirate
Hello, I am 16 & a very shitty programmer who is still learning the fundamentals of CS... 

I hope to get comfortable enough with programming where I can think of something and then be
able to implement it correctly via code.

## Projects
- Zonaimacs // Personal Emacs Configuration (EXWM + LSP)
- Wiggler // Discord Bot (Rust?)
- Real World The Game // Simple board game (TUI?)

# Extra
## KernelCanopy
I'm also interested in founding an Open Source development company
to create software for unix-like systems. This would be under the name "KernelCanopy".

## Software I use:
